# New Tags Sync

> #### Keep your forks synced with new tags in upstream at any time.

## Introduction

Check any new tags in the upstream repos regularly through **GitHub Action** and checkout them into your fork repos.
Forget about the manual hassle now, everything is automatic!

---

### What's the use of this?

If you have experienced modification and distribution based on a project while maintaining updates from the upstream,
you should have experienced the pain of some ***git*** commands. The purpose of this action is to minimize your pain.

### How does this work?

Checkout the upstream new tags as new branches and ***apply*** the patch you provided to make any needed changes, and
then whatever comes next is up to your Github workflow!

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

- Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory.
  An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help
  Documentation
  for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).
- Both the upstream and fork must be in the Github network.

### Inputs

**`base-repository`**:

- **required**

> **Note**
>
> Base (*upstream*) repository name with owner. For example, `torvalds/linux`.

**`head-repository`**:

- **default**
    - [`context github.repository`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)

> **Note**
>
> Head (*fork*) repository name with owner. For example, `Rust-for-Linux/linux`.

**`cloned-path`**:

- **default** - `head-repo`

> **Note**
>
> Relative path
>
under [$GITHUB_WORKSPACE](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)
> to clone the `head repository`.

**`filter-tags`**:

- **default** - `.*`

> **Note**
>
> Filter tags by regular expression. For example, the regex `^v[2-9]\..*` controls tags that only sync versions larger
> than **`v2`**.

**`apply-patch`**:

> **Note**
>
> URL of patch file to be applied after each tag is synced as a branch. Patch url can usually be obtained by comparing
> two branches or commits.
>
> The process of applying patch occurs before the `git push`, so if the value is empty, it means that all new branches
> will be pushed directly to the `head repository` after the tags are synced.
>
> For example, apply all commits that the "head-repository" master branch is ahead of the "base-repository" master
> branch
> to each new tag:
>
> <https://github.com/base-owner/base-repository/compare/master...head-owner:head-repository:master.patch>

> **Warning**
>
> The value based on the [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/).

**`patch-message`**:

- **default** - `Apply patch from ${apply-patch}`

> **Note**
>
> Commit message for `git commit` when applying patch.

**`patch-author`**:

- **default** - `github-actions[bot]`

> **Note**
>
> Author for `git commit` when applying patch.

**`patch-author-email`**:

- **default** - `github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`

> **Note**
>
> Author email for `git commit` when applying patch.

**`patch-committer`**:

- **default** - `github-actions[bot]`

> **Note**
>
> Committer for `git commit` when applying patch.

**`patch-committer-email`**:

- **default** - `github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`

> **Note**
>
> Committer email for `git commit` when applying patch.

**`scripts-after-sync`**:

> **Note**
> Shell scripts runs after each new branch is pushed. Multiple scripts separated by `#!`.
>
> For example, here are two different scripts:
>
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> echo "Hello World"
> 
> 
> #!/bin/bash
> echo "Hello World 2"
> ```

**`github-token`**:

- **default** - `${{ github.token }}`

> **Note**
> Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
> with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
> commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
>
> We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
> Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
